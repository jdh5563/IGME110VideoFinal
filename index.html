        <ul>
            <li>- When thinking about what I wanted to make my ad about, I thought about how I recently got into skateboarding because my friend had gotten one. When I saw his board though, it was all beat up and worn down from use outside. That is when my idea came for a skateboard made for the "real world."</li>
            <li>- I did not actually receive any critiques so there wasn't anything I could do to fix my video. The one change I did make was adding a fading in and out effect at the end of the video.</li>
